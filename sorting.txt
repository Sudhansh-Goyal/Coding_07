when there is an array of size n and each elemnt is in a certain range then we make use of counting sort
when data is uniformally distributed over the array then we make use of bucket sort
when memory writes are costly then we make use of selection sort/cycle sort
when we can swap the adjacent elements then we can make use of bubble sort or cocktail sort
when the number of available elements are very less then we can make use of insertion sort and generally this is the best algorithm
shell sort is one of the algorithms that does not use extra space
usually the time required for sorting the algorithm is nlogn that is usually in merge sort,quick sort,heap sort
predefined sort function uses quick sort and time complexity is nlogn 
stability means if two elements have the same value then while sorting they should appear in the same as in the original array like they are associated with the original array
